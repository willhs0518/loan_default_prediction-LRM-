Abstract: 
Loan defaults (unsuccessful fully paying the loan in a prescript time) may cause financial losses for financial
institutions, therefore it is important to evaluate the customers with their loan history and social characteristics
before lending. In this paper, we proposed a logistic regression method which to predict the loan status and figure
out the influential factors that result in risky loan status. In the modeling process, we focused on the selection of
factors which was highly correlated or contain no/partial information originally. Moreover, we want to suggest a
general idea of risky loan prediction for the lending platforms by explaining the predicted result.
